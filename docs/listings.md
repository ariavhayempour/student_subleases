# Listings

## Lifecycle

- New listings start `review_status = pending`; admins approve, reject, hide, and unhide
  them at `/admin/listings` (see `admin.md`). Locally, `pnpm dev:approve-listing <id>` still approves
  a listing in the local database only, without an audit row.
- Owner status: `active` → `taken` (sets `taken_at`) or `removed`; either can be reactivated.
  An `active` listing whose `available_to` is before today (school timezone) is **expired**.
- Reactivation does not re-check dates: a past-dated listing that is reactivated just stays
  expired (not public). The `available_to ≥ today` check (school timezone) runs on create, and on
  edit only when `availableTo` changes.
- **School and type are fixed after creation** (owner decision). `updateListing` rejects a
  `schoolId` or `type` that differs from the stored row with a `ValidationError` on that field
  ("This can't be changed — delete the listing and post a new one"). The edit form shows both as
  disabled selects (values submitted via hidden inputs) with the hint "To change this, delete the
  listing and post a new one." The create form is unchanged.
- **Public** = active + approved + not expired + owner active + school active
  (`isPublicListing` in `server/services/listing-sql.ts`). Signed-in viewers also never see
  listings when a block exists in either direction.

## Rules (enforced in `server/services/listings.ts`)

- **Cap:** at most 1 listing that is active, `pending`/`approved`/`hidden`, and not expired
  (`countsTowardCap`, `MAX_ACTIVE_LISTINGS`). Admins are exempt (`listingCap`).
- **Home school:** a non-admin can only create a listing in their home school (`ValidationError` on
  `schoolId` otherwise), and the form offers only that school. Admins pick any school.
- **Cross-school viewing:** a signed-in non-admin can open another school's public listing
  (`ListingDetail.crossSchool`) but cannot message, save, or report it; `startConversation`,
  `setFavorite` (saving only) and `createReport` (listings) throw `Forbidden`
  (`server/services/school-lock.ts`). The page hides those actions and says why.
- **Rate limits:** 5 new listings per rolling 24 h per non-admin (listings table); 20 signed photo upload URLs
  per user per clock hour, counted when issued (`RATE_LIMITS.photoUploads`; see `rate-limits.md`).
- **Limit-check order:** photo processing (sharp) is the expensive step, and raw uploads survive a
  failed save, so a rejected save could otherwise be replayed to re-run sharp. `createListing`
  pre-checks both the cap and the 5/day limit before processing. `updateListing` pre-checks the
  cap before processing when the save makes the listing count toward it again (for example
  resubmitting an active `rejected` listing). Every save then re-checks inside the save
  transaction, which takes a per-owner advisory lock (`pg_advisory_xact_lock`) so concurrent
  saves cannot both pass. Status changes (reactivation) run the same locked check.
- **Known gap:** the 5/day limit counts surviving rows only, so delete-and-recreate is not
  limited. Known gap, deferred.
- **Upload limit counts issuance.** Every signed URL counts, whether or not it is used, so unused
  URLs, uploads deleted on save, and parallel requests cannot get around it.
- **Re-review:** title, description, rent, gender preference, address/city/state/ZIP, location,
  unit, or adding a photo → `pending` (clears `review_note`). Removing or reordering photos,
  dates, rooms, roommates, private bathroom, furnished, amenities, and status changes keep the
  current review status. School and type can't change on edit, so they need no re-review. The 20/hour upload limit and the "any added photo" re-review rule are
  owner decisions. Editing a `rejected` listing always
  resubmits it; a `hidden` one stays hidden. "Resubmit" in `/me/listings` is the edit flow.
- **Stale edits:** `updateListing` re-reads the listing (`FOR UPDATE`) and its photo ids inside
  the transaction and throws `Conflict` if the review status or photo set changed since the edit
  began (for example an admin hid the listing). Sharp work stays outside the transaction.
- **Normalization:** `private_bathroom` is NULL unless `roommates_count > 0`; blank unit → NULL;
  `room_features` and `amenities` are de-duplicated.
- **Form model:** the details step reveals groups in order, each once the previous is answered
  (`lib/listing-reveal.ts`; edit mode shows all): property type (`apartment` or `house`, fixed after
  creation; the new-listing picker also shows a disabled "Parking spot (coming soon)" option, not
  in `LISTING_TYPES`) → bedrooms, bathrooms, roommates (0 reads "No roommates") → gender preference (always
  asked) → room type (`single` or `shared`) → room features, furnished, and a private-bathroom
  answer when roommates > 0 → amenities. `amenities` must come from the list for the property type
  (`HOUSE_AMENITIES` or `APARTMENT_AMENITIES` in `lib/listing-options.ts`); on a house edit,
  stored amenities outside the house list are dropped on load.
- **Legacy `room` type:** migration `0011` converted `room` listings to `apartment` and kept the
  value in the Postgres enum until a contract migration; app code reads any `room` as `apartment`
  (`toListingType`).
- Non-owners get `NotFound` (not `Forbidden`) for edit, status, and delete. A malformed
  (non-UUID) id in `setListingStatus` gets `ValidationError`; it reveals nothing about existence.
- **Storage cleanup after commit is best-effort.** Raw uploads, removed photos, and a deleted
  listing's photos are deleted via `bestEffort`, which reports failures to Sentry. A storage
  failure never fails a committed save; leftovers are removed by the daily cleanup cron
  (`storage.md`, Cleanup: `/api/cron/cleanup`, 24-hour grace). If the save itself fails, the
  newly processed photos are deleted instead.

## Unit privacy

`getListingDetail` returns `unit` only to the owner, admins, and a renter with a conversation on
that listing (it sets `conversationId`, the viewer's conversation as renter, which also drives the
button below). The unit also shows in the thread header to both participants. It is never in Open
Graph tags, cards, `/me/listings`, the inbox, or Realtime payloads (see `messaging.md`).

A visitor who blocked the owner, or was blocked by them, gets a 404 for the listing.

## Distance

The form warns (non-blocking) when the address is farther than the school's `warn_radius_km`
using a browser-side haversine (`lib/geo.ts`). Stored and displayed distances use PostGIS
`ST_Distance`; the two differ by under 0.5%.

## Decisions that can look like bugs

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` is also used server-side for Storage (`server/storage/client.ts`).
- Listing E2E seeds rows via SQL; the create form is verified manually.
- Locally, address search uses the Mapbox default public token, which has no URL restriction
  (creating a restricted token needs a card on the account). Production should get a
  URL-restricted token later.

## Pages

`/listings/new`, `/listings/[id]/edit` (owner), `/me/listings` (owner; `?notice=` banners),
`/[school]/listings/[id]` (public when public; `noindex`; Open Graph without the unit), `/[school]` (browse; see `search.md`),
`/me/favorites` (signed in, onboarded; `noindex`).
The listing page shows **Report listing** to signed-in visitors (not the owner or admins); see
`moderation.md`.
The host's name and join date (`host`) are returned only to the owner, admins, and signed-in
students whose home school is the listing's school; signed-out and other-school visitors get
`host: null` and see a locked "Student host" placeholder.
The listing page shows **Message host** to visitors (owners and admins see no button); it becomes
**View conversation** when `conversationId` is set. `/messages`, `/messages/new?listing=<id>`, and
`/messages/[id]` are described in `messaging.md`.
